The directory Wombat16F15214.X contains the MPLAB X project for the SerialWombat 4A and 4B.  
Included are 4 project configurations, 2 each for I2C and UART.  
The two versions are a standard version that targets the PIC16F15214 and a debug version
that targets the PIC16F15224, and shifts the pins from PORT A to PORT C in order to facilitate
having all 4 pins and communications attached while using an ICD4 or PICKIT4 for debugging.
